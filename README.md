# Illusions
This repository contains the experiments for my master's thesis \<TITLE HERE\>. We explore the dynamics of auditory and audio-visual illusions using artificial neural networks. Current focus is on auditory illusions however we aim to also include AV speech illusions such as McGurk effect.
## Auditory


### Verbal Transformation Effect

For initial experiments, we use the same repeating stimuli from Warren (1968) and a set of pre-trained speech-to-text models: Wav2Vec2... [add more as you experiment] 

**TODO:**
- [x] Wav2Vec2ForCTC - No effect observed
- [x] Wav2Vec2BertForCTC - No effect observed
- [ ] Wav2Vec2ConformerForCTC
- [x] WhisperForConditionalGeneration - No effect observed
